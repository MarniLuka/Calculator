Just as you would a normal calculator, click on the numbers and operations you need. In the upper part of the display, it will show you the equation you've made, and when you click on the equal sign, the result will appear beneath the equation. To clear the display, simply press AC. And to delete the most recent input, not the entire equation, simply press DE.
